# Enrollment Fix Tracking Document

## Problem Summary
Users experience enrollment issues where:
1. Transaction appears successful but enrollment state doesn't persist
2. UI shows "Already enrolled" errors despite user not being enrolled on-chain
3. Page reloads reset enrollment state
4. Inconsistent behavior between different enrollment methods

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Contract Address Inconsistencies
- **Legacy Contract**: `0x7Ed5CC0cf0B0532b52024a0DDa8fAE24C6F66dc3` (deprecated)
- **Optimized Contract**: `0x4193D2f9Bf93495d4665C485A3B8AadAF78CDf29` (current)
- **Issue**: Multiple hooks and components using different contract addresses

### 2. ABI Mismatches
- Legacy ABI functions: `claim()`, `hasBadge()`, `claimed()`, `balanceOf()`
- Optimized ABI functions: `enroll()`, `isEnrolled()`, `completeModule()`
- **Issue**: Hooks calling non-existent functions on optimized contract

### 3. Environment Variable Dependencies
- Missing or inconsistent environment variables in production
- Fallback logic reverting to legacy contract addresses
- **Issue**: Production behavior differs from local development

### 4. Cache Management
- React Query cache not invalidating after enrollment
- Stale data causing UI inconsistencies
- **Issue**: Successful transactions not reflected in UI state

## Previous Fix Attempts

### Attempt #1: Environment Variable Configuration
- **Action**: Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPTIMIZED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ALFAJORES`
- **Result**: Partial success, but fallback issues remained
- **Outcome**: FAILED - Still using legacy contract in some paths

### Attempt #2: Hook Updates
- **Action**: Updated individual hooks to use optimized contract
- **Result**: Some hooks fixed, others still had issues
- **Outcome**: PARTIAL - Inconsistencies between hooks remained

### Attempt #3: ABI Standardization
- **Action**: Updated ABIs to match optimized contract
- **Result**: Reduced errors but enrollment persistence issues remained
- **Outcome**: PARTIAL - Cache invalidation issues not addressed

### Attempt #4: Complete Reversion to Legacy
- **Action**: Reverted all hooks to use legacy contract
- **Result**: Basic functionality restored but with gas inefficiency
- **Outcome**: TEMPORARY - Not the desired long-term solution

### Attempt #5: Hardcoded Contract Addresses
- **Action**: Hardcoded optimized contract address in all hooks
- **Result**: Still experiencing revert errors and state persistence issues
- **Outcome**: FAILED - Underlying transaction issues not resolved

## Current Status
- **Contract Deployment**: Optimized contract verified as deployed and functional
- **Transaction Execution**: Transactions being sent but results inconsistent
- **UI State**: Enrollment state not persisting across page reloads
- **User Experience**: Broken enrollment flow

## Systematic Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Audit and Standardize (COMPLETED)
1. **Complete File Audit**
   - [x] Scan all files for contract addresses and ABIs
   - [x] Document all inconsistencies
   - [x] Create single source of truth configuration

2. **Create Unified Configuration**
   - [x] Single contract configuration file (`lib/contracts/optimized-badge-config.ts`)
   - [x] Consistent ABI across all hooks
   - [x] Standardized cache configuration

### Phase 2: Implementation (COMPLETED)
1. **Update All Hooks**
   - [x] useSimpleBadge.ts - Use unified config
   - [x] useSponsoredEnrollment.ts - Use unified config
   - [x] useZeroDevEnrollment.ts - Use unified config
   - [x] All read hooks (useHasBadge, etc.) - Use unified config

2. **Fix Cache Management**
   - [x] Implement proper cache invalidation after transactions
   - [x] Add React Query cache invalidation with setTimeout
   - [x] Consistent cache configuration across all hooks

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - [ ] Test enrollment flow with each hook
   - [ ] Verify state persistence across reloads
   - [ ] Confirm gas savings with optimized contract

2. **Production Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy with proper environment variables
   - [ ] Monitor transaction success rates
   - [ ] Validate user experience improvements

## Key Principles for This Fix

### 1. Single Source of Truth
All contract interactions MUST use the same:
- Contract address: `0x4193D2f9Bf93495d4665C485A3B8AadAF78CDf29`
- ABI with functions: `enroll()`, `isEnrolled()`, `completeModule()`
- No fallbacks to legacy contract

### 2. Immediate Cache Updates
After successful transactions:
- Invalidate React Query cache
- Refetch enrollment status
- Update UI state immediately

### 3. Proper Error Handling
- Decode revert reasons from failed transactions
- Provide clear user feedback
- Log detailed error information for debugging

### 4. Environment Consistency
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- No silent fallbacks that mask configuration issues
- Consistent behavior across environments

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can enroll successfully
- [ ] Enrollment state persists across page reloads
- [ ] No "Already enrolled" errors for non-enrolled users
- [ ] Gas costs reduced by 99.5% as intended
- [ ] Consistent behavior across all enrollment methods
- [ ] Module completion works after enrollment

## Implementation Summary (Phase 1-2 Complete)

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Created Unified Contract Configuration** (`lib/contracts/optimized-badge-config.ts`):
   - Single source of truth for contract address: `0x4193D2f9Bf93495d4665C485A3B8AadAF78CDf29`
   - Optimized contract ABI with only existing functions: `enroll()`, `isEnrolled()`, `completeModule()`, etc.
   - Shared cache configuration for consistent behavior
   - Removed all legacy contract references

2. **Updated All Enrollment Hooks**:
   - `useSimpleBadge.ts`: Now uses unified config, added cache invalidation
   - `useSponsoredEnrollment.ts`: Updated to use unified config and proper cache management
   - `useZeroDevEnrollment.ts`: Consistent with other hooks, proper cache invalidation
   - All read functions (`useHasBadge`, `useHasClaimed`, etc.) now use `isEnrolled()` function

3. **Implemented Proper Cache Management**:
   - React Query cache invalidation after successful transactions
   - Short cache times (5s) for enrollment status to catch recent changes
   - Automatic cache refresh after enrollment/module completion
   - Consistent cache keys across all hooks

### Key Changes Made:
- **Eliminated All Contract Address Inconsistencies**: All hooks now use the same hardcoded optimized contract address
- **Fixed ABI Mismatches**: Removed legacy functions like `claim()`, `hasBadge()`, `balanceOf()` - now only using optimized contract functions
- **Added Cache Invalidation**: After enrollment/module completion transactions, React Query cache is invalidated to show updated state immediately
- **Unified Configuration**: Single import source for all contract interactions

## Next Actions
1. Test end-to-end enrollment flow with updated hooks
2. Verify enrollment state persists across page reloads
3. Confirm no more "Already enrolled" errors for non-enrolled users
4. Deploy to production with proper environment variables
